              <p>
                On this week’s Cosmic Queries episode of
                StarTalk Radio, we cover science,
                philosophy, social economics, government
                oversight, and a lot more…all under one
                subject: Bioethics. Neil deGrasse Tyson is
                joined by comic co-host Paul Mecurio and
                returning guest NYU bioethicist and
                philosopher Matthew Liao to answer
                fan-submitted questions on bioethics.

                As a fan of film and TV, it’s one of my
                fatal flaws that I have not watched a single
                episode of Game of Thrones. However, that
                being said, I am acutely aware of its
                cultural significance and its mighty impact
                on this age of storytelling on the screen.

                  I am a writer, improviser, filmmaker, and graphic designer. I graduated from Franklin College in 2016 with a B.A. Degree in Broadcast Journalism and Graphic Design. Before that, I had a very lovely childhood that exposed me to the things that I'm passionate about today: writing, comedy, filmmaking, graphic design, and golf. I love golf. I believe you can always make your own opportunities. I also believe that laughing cures everything. If you want more info on me, you can find my CV and Resume below this sentence.
